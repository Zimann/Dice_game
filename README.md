# Game details
- The game starts with two players on each side of the screen with a picture that has dice-like dots on it. 
- The first player that starts, is the one on the left side (player 1).
- Players can also type in their preferred names.

## How to play the game
- The game starts when the first player clicks the "Roll" button under the picture.
- The number on the dice will be added to that player's score. However if the dice has only one(1) dot on it, then that player's score will be reset to zero(0).
- Players also have the option of rolling the dice a couple of times and then passing the roll option to the other player, while keeping the accumulated points. If the other player rolls a one (1) then the turns will also switch again.
